# Implementation of the Lagrangian Relaxation Algorithm for Network Revenue Management

<br>

This repository provides a public implementation of the Lagrangian Relaxation Algorithm for network revenue management, originally developed by Prof. Huseyin Topaloglu (2009). 
Researchers in operations research often use this algorithm and its test dataset as benchmarks, but no open implementation has been available until now. 
This code allows researchers to test, compare, and build upon the algorithm easily. 
I have tested our implementation on all instances in Prof. Topaloglu's dataset, and the results match those reported in his paper. 

I developed this project as part of my research with Prof. Baris Ata on solving NRM problems with deep learning-based numerical methods. 
I hope this implementation will help others support reproducible research and further work in network revenue management.

For detailed information, see the [documentation](docs/documentation.pdf).
